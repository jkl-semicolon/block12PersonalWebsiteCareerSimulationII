Decided to try my hand with a new website, as opposed to continuing the previous one. 
This website is for a house my girlfriend owns; she rents it short-term as an AirBnB.

Spent a a decent amount of time on the nav bar and background. Background features
gradient colors, and nav bar has a no-background .jpg and has hover effects over 
the nav links.

Got caught up formatting the forms page, as I just couldn't get the spacing down.
I had too many nested divs and it really made it hard for me to visualize and think 
about what was going on.

Still need to add photograph and house info pages.
